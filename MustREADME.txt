PART 5 REACT JS
Topic:

1. Introduction to TypeScript (I will skip this because I want to know JS better first)
2. ESLint (Session 25 : 1:19:30)


2. ESLint (1:19:30)
    - Open eslint.org >documentation > getting started 
    - The main function is to find and fix the JavaScript code
        - Make the our code consistent and prevents bugs
    - Use ESLint in development phase (before we build the code)
    - We can turn on and off the ESLint when we need it.
