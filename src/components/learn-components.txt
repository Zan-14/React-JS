TYPE:

npm run dev 

on the terminal before working. The function is similar to the live server version in HTML

My Summary:

*GENERAL
-Component in React is similar to <div> in HTML
-We create a lot of <div> elements to make a whole page (maybe with semantic like header, main, section, etc. But generally these are <div>)
-Creating a whole page in React is actually put some components together. These components maybe like header, hero-section, footer, main-content, articles, etc.
-These components will be used and exported in the app.jsx file.

*Parent and child components in React
- App.jsx is actually a parent component. So a huge component because it will contain all of the other components inside it before the main.jsx render it into HTML. We can call App.jsx as a main parent component.
- On the other hand, we create some components like main-section.jsx, hero-section.jsx, article.jsx, list-articles.jsx for example. the role will be like this:
    > parent component : 
    1. main-section.jsx, because inside it we will import or put hero-section.jsx and article.jsx and maybe other components as well.
    2.article.jsx, because inside it we will import list-articles.jsx. We want article.jsx as the template form of the article, and then the list-articles.jsx will provide the source or data of the articles.

    > child component :
    1. hero-section.jsx, because we put this into main-section.jsx
    2. article.jsx, because we put this into main-section.jsx
    3. list-article.jsx, because we use it inside the article.jsx

Conclusion: It's relative to a component become a parent component or a child component. article.jsx is a parent component to list-articles.jsx, but is a child component to main-section.jsx

*Reusable components
- these components (list-article, article, form, navbar, footer) can be used repeatly and MODIFIED without changing the source or data of the components. Example: we want to use article.jsx twice inside the main-section.jsx but with different styles and data sources. We can do it without creating something like article1.jsx and article2.jsx

Warning! 
The name of the component file and the component function can be different. To use / import a component, you need to use the function name, not the file name.
